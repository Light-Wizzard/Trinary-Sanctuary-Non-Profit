Trinary Sanctuary Non-Profit Organization

Trinary is the 3 logical state changes in Atoms and is about the Science of Atoms. Trinary Sanctuary is a non-profit organization that is built to withstand an ice age. The concept is that the Government donates Land for Trinary Sanctuary to build on. Trinary takes donations for Equipment and Material. The Military takes over the project, and enlist people that want to work there. Trinary Sanctuary has to provide everything that everyone needs to survive for Free. The concept is that people work for Free, and get everything they need for Free. Trinary Sanctuary has its own Laws, and not the Laws of the Government that support them. The Military that trains them, and to whom they answer to set any laws they follow. This concept is to run this facility with a new society that is not based on any society in history, it will be the first Free Society in history. The goal is to produce sustainable power and other resources for the country that support them. All the money made by the Military selling these resources goes to paying down the National Debt for that Government.

The reason for Trinary Sanctuary is to form a new type of Government not based on Money, Law or Religion. The reason it is based on No Money is simple, the country I live in, which is the United States of America, commits Treason to have the Federal Reserve print their Money. And now they cannot make the Interest payment on the Loan, and no way to pay it off. 

The only way Trinary Sanctuary can pay down the loan, instead of paying it off, is because currently it is not possible to pay it off; because they are borrowing more than anyone could keep up with. The realistic goal is to pay down the interest payment so that we can start paying on the loan itself, and not just the interest payments; something the United States has never done. There is no other way to pay off the debt unless everything is free. The purpose of Trinary Sanctuary is to enlist people what will take an Oath to Trinary Sanctuary, to work for free, live free, and stay free; so it has no debt.

Trinary Sanctuary will provide the Governments with excess power, food, water, and manufactured products; that the Military will sell to pay down the National Debt.

Trinary Sanctuary does not allow Laws because all Laws allow Treason. Therefore, you cannot trust any Laws, nor the People making them, and Enforcing them. 

The Military will have to take full control of this project, this document is a reference to get the project started.
